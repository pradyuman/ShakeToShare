Shake2Share
===========

This project was built at Wildhacks 2014 (Northwestern University) by Andrew Braun, Pradyuman Vig, Krishna Mittal, Harshit Agarwal and Nihar Sheth. It won the Microsoft Sponsor Prize at the hackathon.

The program is way to send contact information by shaking hands (using Pebble smartwatches and Android). This hack can also be modified to send payment information by venmo, etc using different gestures (its something that can be done with the way we have coded this hack but it wasn't implemented at the hackathon due to the time constraint).
